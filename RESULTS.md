## Parameter Analysis

We systematically varied four key parameters to understand their impact on compression performance:

### 1. Document Size

**What it is**: The length of input text, measured in characters. We tested sizes from 500 to 3,000 characters.

**Key Findings**:
- **Compression improves with document size**: From 65.2% (500 chars) to 75.3% (3,000 chars)
- **Processing time scales roughly linearly**: ~10ms per character for LLM-based methods
- **Sweet spot**: 2,000+ characters for optimal compression efficiency

**Why this happens**: Longer documents provide more context for the LLM to make accurate predictions, leading to lower token ranks and better compression. The LLM can leverage patterns and repetitions across the entire document.

**Story**: A 500-character snippet about yachts compresses to 65%, but a full 3,000-character article achieves 75% compression. The LLM learns domain-specific vocabulary and writing patterns, making subsequent predictions more accurate.

### 2. Batch Size

**What it is**: The number of token predictions processed simultaneously using the model's batch dimension. We tested batch sizes of 1, 2, 4, and 8.

**Key Findings**:
- **Dramatic speedup**: 3.86x faster processing (84.3s ‚Üí 21.8s) with batch_size=4
- **Minimal compression loss**: Only 0.4% reduction (73.7% ‚Üí 73.3%) for 4x speedup
- **Diminishing returns**: Beyond batch_size=4, gains plateau while compression slightly degrades

**Why this works**: Modern GPUs excel at parallel processing. By batching multiple predictions, we utilize available compute capacity more efficiently while maintaining sequential processing within each batch.

**Story**: Processing a 3,000-character document token-by-token takes 84 seconds. With batch_size=4, we process 4 predictions simultaneously, reducing time to 22 seconds while maintaining nearly identical compression quality.

### 3. Context Window Size

**What it is**: The maximum number of previous tokens the LLM considers when predicting the next token. We tested windows of 100, 300, 500, and 1024 tokens (GPT-2's maximum).

**Key Findings**:
- **More context = better compression**: From 68.2% (100 tokens) to 73.7% (1024 tokens)
- **Processing time increases**: From 12.1s to 20.9s as context grows
- **Optimal trade-off**: 300 tokens provides 70.3% compression in 16.9s (19% faster than unlimited)

**Why context matters**: Larger context windows allow the LLM to maintain longer-term dependencies and patterns, leading to more accurate predictions and lower token ranks.

**Story**: With only 100 tokens of context, the LLM might predict "the" as the 50th most likely next word. With 1024 tokens of context about sailing, it might rank "the" as the 5th most likely, dramatically improving compression.

### 4. Compression Algorithm

**What it is**: The traditional compression method applied to the token rank sequences. We compared raw zlib, tokenizer+zlib, and various LLM-based approaches.

#### Baseline Methods:
- **Raw zlib**: Direct compression of UTF-8 encoded text
- **Tokenizer + zlib**: Tokenize first, then compress token IDs with zlib

#### LLM-Based Methods:
- **LLM ranks + zlib**: Convert text to ranks, compress with zlib
- **LLM ranks + Huffman (basic)**: Frequency-table based Huffman coding
- **LLM ranks + Huffman (Zipf)**: Parametric Zipf distribution modeling
- **LLM ranks + Huffman (Zipf-bytes)**: Zipf with binary parameter storage

**Key Findings**:
- **LLM methods dominate**: 73-75% compression vs 47-55% for traditional methods
- **Zipf modeling crucial**: 67.3% vs 32.0% compression (basic Huffman)
- **Binary optimization matters**: 75.3% vs 67.3% compression through parameter efficiency

## Technical Deep Dives

### Why Zipf Distribution Modeling?

**The Problem**: Basic Huffman coding requires storing the frequency of every unique rank value. For sparse distributions (many ranks appear only once), this creates enormous overhead.

**The Solution**: Model rank frequencies using a Zipf distribution: f(k) = k^(-s) / Œ£(i^(-s))

**Why Zipf?**: Token ranks naturally follow power-law distributions - a few low ranks are very common, while high ranks are rare. This matches Zipf's mathematical form perfectly.

**Storage Efficiency**: Instead of storing thousands of frequency pairs, we store just one parameter (s) that describes the entire distribution shape.

**Example**: For a 2,000-character text with 500 unique ranks:
- Basic approach: Store 500 frequency pairs = ~4,000 bytes overhead
- Zipf approach: Store 1 parameter = 4 bytes overhead
- **Result**: 99.9% reduction in distribution storage overhead

### Why Byte Optimization?

**The Problem**: Python's `pickle` module adds substantial overhead when serializing simple data structures.

**The Discovery**: Storing just 3 parameters (zipf_s, max_rank, total_count) with pickle required 232 bytes of overhead.

**The Solution**: Binary format using struct.pack():
- `zipf_s`: float32 (4 bytes)
- `max_rank`: uint32 (4 bytes)  
- `total_count`: uint32 (4 bytes)
- **Total**: 12 bytes instead of 232 bytes

**Impact**: 47% compression improvement on small texts where parameter overhead was significant.

**Example**: 1,000-character text compression:
- With pickle: 468 bytes (parameter overhead dominates)
- With binary: 248 bytes (75.3% compression achieved)

### Why Parallel Processing Works

**The Challenge**: LLM prediction is inherently sequential - each token depends on all previous tokens.

**The Innovation**: Use the model's batch dimension to process multiple independent sequences simultaneously, while maintaining sequential processing within each sequence.

**Implementation**: Split text into overlapping chunks, process multiple chunks in parallel, then merge results while preserving sequential dependencies.

**Result**: Near-linear speedup with batch size while maintaining compression quality.

### Statistical Significance
Each parameter combination tested multiple times with consistent results. Error margins typically <2% for compression ratios, <5% for timing measurements.
